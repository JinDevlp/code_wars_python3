#In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

# Examples
# high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
# high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
# high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"
# Notes
# All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
# There will always be at least one number in the input string.
# Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.


- Numbers in given list are in string format
- Since the numbers are in string format, I need to turn it into integers
- I need to split the numbers into individual string before I turn them into integers
- Find the max number and min number

def high_and_low(numbers):
    nums = [int(num) for num in numbers.split()]
    return f"{max(nums)} {min(nums)}"
