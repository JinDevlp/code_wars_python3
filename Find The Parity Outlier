# You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. 
# The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. 
# Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.


# O(n)

# I can check on each integers in the array to see if it is an even number or odd number
# Make a seperate arrays to store even numbers and odd numbers
# Check which array has longer length
# Return the value of the array
